# fundamentalsOfDataAnalysis

This is the repository for my submission for the Fundamentals of Data Analysis assingment. The assignment consists of four Python tasks in a single Jupyter notebook: task 1 contains a function for counting list items in a dictionary; task 2 uses that code to simulate dicerolls and track the resulting summed values; task 3 uses the binomial distribution function to simulate coinflips and plots the results; task 4 uses Numpy and Matplotlib to demonstrate [Simpson's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox).

The Jupyter notebook does not contain any interactive elements or require any action from the reader, beyond simply clicking into the notebook.
